This article explores the neuroscience of approach-driven versus avoidance-driven activism and how the way we frame our cause can support psychological resilience, hope, and healthier long-term engagement. If protesting is on your bucket list, the key is choosing causes and actions that help you build something meaningful, rather than only reacting to what you oppose.
