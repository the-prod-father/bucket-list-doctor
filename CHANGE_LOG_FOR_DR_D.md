### Change #12: Media Assets Organization
**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Time Invested:** 30 minutes
**Complexity:** Medium-High (Unicode character challenge)

**What We Did:**
Organized and renamed all media assets (logos, media appearances, professional photos) from screenshot folders into proper directory structure.

**Files Organized:**

**1. Bucket List Doctor Logo**
- **Source:** `docs/squarespace-site-reference/screenshots/blog/imgs/BUCKETLISTDOCTOR-LOGO.webp`
- **Destination:** `public/images/logos/bucketlist-doctor-logo.webp`
- **Size:** 59 KB
- **Usage:** CrossSiteNavigation component, future branding

**2. ED180 Logo**
- **Source:** `docs/squarespace-site-reference/screenshots/blog/imgs/ED180-LOGO.jpg`
- **Destination:** `public/images/logos/ed180-logo.jpg`
- **Size:** 106 KB
- **Usage:** CrossSiteNavigation component (ed-180.com link)

**3. KTRS 550 ABC News Radio Logo**
- **Source:** `docs/squarespace-site-reference/screenshots/blog/imgs/Screenshot 2025-10-23 at 11.27.04 AM.png`
- **Destination:** `public/images/media/ktrs-550-abc-news-radio-logo.png`
- **Size:** 299 KB
- **Usage:** MediaAppearances component (new)

**4. News 12 Long Island Logo**
- **Source:** `docs/squarespace-site-reference/screenshots/blog/imgs/Screenshot 2025-10-23 at 11.28.50 AM.png`
- **Destination:** `public/images/media/news12-long-island-logo.png`
- **Size:** 159 KB
- **Usage:** MediaAppearances component (new)

**5. Professional Headshot**
- **Source:** `docs/squarespace-site-reference/screenshots/blog/imgs/Screenshot 2025-10-23 at 11.26.18 AM (1).png`
- **Destination:** `public/images/profile/dr-desarbo-professional-headshot.jpg`
- **Size:** 95 KB
- **Usage:** CrossSiteNavigation for drdesarbo.com link, About page

**Technical Challenge - Unicode Characters:**
The screenshot files contained `\u202f` (narrow no-break space) characters instead of regular spaces in the filenames. This caused standard bash `cp` commands to fail.

**Solution:**
Used Python with `os.listdir()` to read actual filenames and pattern matching to copy files:

```python
import shutil
import os

src_dir = "/Users/gmac/Dev/bucket-list-doctor/docs/squarespace-site-reference/screenshots/blog/imgs/"
dest_dir = "/Users/gmac/Dev/bucket-list-doctor/public/images/media/"

for filename in os.listdir(src_dir):
    if "11.27.04" in filename and "AM.png" in filename and "(1)" not in filename:
        shutil.copy2(os.path.join(src_dir, filename),

### Change #13: Critical URL Fix - drdesarbo.com
**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Time Invested:** 15 minutes
**Complexity:** Low (but CRITICAL impact)

**What We Did:**
Fixed critical error where code referenced "doctordesarbo.com" instead of the correct "drdesarbo.com"

**Your Quote:** "and the website for dr desarbo.com is not doctordesarbo.com its drdesarbo.com"

**File Modified:** `/components/home/CrossSiteNavigation.tsx`

**Changes Made:**

**Line 23-24: Site ID and URL**
```typescript
// BEFORE:
{
  id: 'doctordesarbo',
  url: 'https://www.doctordesarbo.com',

// AFTER:
{
  id: 'drdesarbo',
  url: 'https://www.drdesarbo.com',
```

**Line 22: Site Name Display**
```typescript
// BEFORE:
name: 'Doctor DeSarbo',

// AFTER:
name: 'Dr. DeSarbo',
```

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ External link now points to correct domain
- ‚úÖ Consistent "Dr." abbreviation instead of full "Doctor"
- ‚úÖ Users can now successfully navigate to your medical practice site

**Documentation Updated:**
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Updated cross-site integration section with correct URL

**Why This Matters:**
This was a CRITICAL fix. The wrong URL would send visitors to a non-existent or wrong website, causing frustration and lost opportunities for cross-promotion between your sites. This is especially important before your radio interview when traffic will increase.

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Correct URL now implemented

```

**Line 13: Description Update**

// AFTER:

```

**Visual Result:**
- ED180 logo now displays in cross-site navigation cards
- Logo is professional, high-quality (106 KB JPG)
- Matches styling of other site cards
- Includes yellow glow hover effect matching brand colors
