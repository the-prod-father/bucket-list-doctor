# Asset Placement Guide - Dr. DeSarbo Updates

**Date:** November 4, 2025  
**Purpose:** Exact file locations for all assets from email attachments

---

## 📁 Directory Structure

All assets should be placed in the `public/` directory. Here's exactly where each file should go:

---

## 🖼️ IMAGES

### 1. Media Logos (for homepage "As Featured On" section)

**Location:** `public/images/media/`

Place these files here:
- ✅ `newsday-logo.png` (or `.jpg`, `.webp` - whatever format you have)
- ✅ `doctor-radio-logo.png` (or `.jpg`, `.webp`)
- ✅ `siriusxm-logo.png` (if separate from Doctor Radio - optional)
- ✅ `wjr-760-logo.png` (optional - from email attachment)
- ✅ `koa-logo.png` (optional - from email attachment)

**Note:** If you have the logos in a different format (jpg, webp, etc.), that's fine - just use the same filename with the correct extension.

---

### 2. Book Covers Image (for homepage lower right corner)

**Location:** `public/images/books/`

Place this file here:
- ✅ `book-covers-hero.png` (or `.jpg`, `.webp` - the image showing two books overlapping)

**Note:** This is the image from the email that shows the main book and workbook side-by-side.

---

### 3. Your Brain Story Images (3 pictures)

**Location:** `public/images/brain-story/`

Create this directory if it doesn't exist, then place:
- ✅ `brain-story-1.jpg` (or `.png` - first picture)
- ✅ `brain-story-2.jpg` (or `.png` - second picture)
- ✅ `brain-story-3.jpg` (or `.png` - third picture)

**Note:** These are the 3 pictures that go with the story about "the brain on a bucket list" that will be added to the Your Brain page.

---

## 🎥 VIDEO FILES

### 4. Speaker Trailer Video

**Location:** `public/videos/`

Create this directory if it doesn't exist, then place:
- ✅ `speaker-trailer.mov` (original file from email)

**Note:** We'll convert this to web-friendly format (mp4) during implementation, but place the original .mov file here first.

---

## 🎵 AUDIO FILES

### 5. Google Notes Audio Files

**Location:** `public/audio/google-notes/`

Create these directories if they don't exist, then place:
- ✅ All Google Notes audio files here (whatever format they are - .mp3, .m4a, .wav, etc.)

**Note:** Just drop all the audio files from the email attachment into this folder. We'll organize them during implementation.

---

## 📄 DOCUMENTS

### 6. Word Documents / Text Files

**Location:** `docs/dr-desarbo-content/`

Create this directory if it doesn't exist, then place:
- ✅ `professional-summary-new.txt` (or `.docx`, `.doc` - the new Professional Summary copy)
- ✅ `your-brain-story.txt` (or `.docx`, `.doc` - the story content with 3 pictures)

**Note:** If you have Word documents, you can place them here as-is. We'll extract the text during implementation.

---

### 7. Articles

**Location:** `docs/dr-desarbo-content/articles/`

Create this directory if it doesn't exist, then place:
- ✅ All article files here (PDF, Word docs, text files - whatever format they are)

**Note:** Just drop all article files from the email attachment into this folder. We'll process them during implementation.

## 🚀 After You Place the Files

Once you've placed all the assets:

1. **Let me know** which files you've placed
2. **Tell me** if any files are missing or if you have questions about file formats
3. **I'll verify** the file structure and then we can start implementation

---

## 📝 Notes

- **File formats:** Don't worry about exact formats - if you have jpg instead of png, or docx instead of txt, that's fine. We can work with whatever you have.
- **File names:** Try to match the suggested filenames, but if you need to use different names, just let me know what you named them.
- **Missing files:** If you don't have certain files (like optional logos), that's okay - we can work around it or find alternatives.
- **Directory creation:** If any directories don't exist, create them. The structure should be:
  ```
  public/
  ├── images/
  │   ├── media/
  │   ├── books/
  │   └── brain-story/
  ├── videos/
  └── audio/
      └── google-notes/
  
  docs/
  └── dr-desarbo-content/
      └── articles/
  ```

**Ready when you are!** Just place the files and let me know what you've got. 🎯
