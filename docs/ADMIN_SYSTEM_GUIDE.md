## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Newsletter Won't Send

**Check 1: Resend API Key**

# Verify environment variable is set
# In Vercel: Settings > Environment Variables
# Look for: RESEND_API_KEY
```

**Check 2: Active Subscribers**
```
# In admin dashboard
# Go to Newsletter > Subscribers
# Confirm "Active" count > 0
```

**Check 3: Email Validation**
```
# Invalid emails will fail silently
# Check subscriber list for typos
# Verify email addresses are valid
```

**Check 4: Rate Limits**
```
# Resend free tier: 3,000 emails/month
# System sends max 50 at a time
# Wait 1 second between batches
```

### Can't Login to Admin

**Issue: "Invalid username or password"**
- Check username is exactly: `Dr. D` or `prodfather` (case sensitive)
- Check password has no extra spaces
- Clear browser cookies and try again

**Issue: Database connection error**
- Verify POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING in env variables
- Check Supabase project is active
- Database may need restart (rare)

### Subscribers Not Showing

**Issue: Count shows 0 but people signed up**
- Check database directly in Supabase dashboard
- Verify newsletter_subscribers table exists
- Check RLS policies are correct
- May need to refresh page
