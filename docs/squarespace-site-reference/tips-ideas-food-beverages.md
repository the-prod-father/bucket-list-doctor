## Tips and Advice for Food & Drink with Your Bucket List

Say "yes" to at least one new food or drink wherever you go—even if it's just a small taste. It may be a bucket list food, drink, or restaurant you have on your list before you go or one you discover there and add to your list after you've tried something new!

When traveling, ask locals:

- What do you eat on holidays?
- What's your favorite childhood meal?
- Are there any special restaurants or dishes we should try?
- What beverage should every visitor try at least once?

## Explore Local Grocery Stores & Bodegas

Grocery stores abroad (and even in your own city) are treasure chests of unique snacks, drinks, spices, and staples. Many stores and smaller bodegas often carry exotic fruits, foods, and drinks from other countries. Visit this section of the store often as a regular bucket list activity.

Try foreign candy, canned delicacies, locally brewed sodas, or strange fruit.

Bring a few items home (as allowed) as edible souvenirs—or host a "taste testing" with friends.

Rare and unusual foods and delicacies make excellent gifts for friends and family as well.

## Eat Locally at Home Too

Bucket list food experiences don't require a plane ticket.

Explore cuisines you've never tried at restaurants or food trucks.

Visit ethnic markets in your area.

Experiment with unique recipe books, new spices, and non-traditional cooking techniques such as underground pit cooking (Earth Ovens), hot stone cooking, sous-vide, and smoking with unusual aromatics.

## Sample Rare, Iconic and Unusual Bucket List Food Experiences From Around the World

Here are a few memorable (and sometimes strange) dishes that reflect the unique taste of their regions:

**Coffee cultures:** Try espresso standing up in Italy, Turkish coffee with the grounds, or sweetened Vietnamese egg coffee.

**Local brews and spirits:** Sample rakija (Balkans), sake (Japan), mezcal (Mexico), or amarula (South Africa)—but know your limits, especially with stronger liquors!

## Lesser-Known Food Experiences to Add to Your List

- Take a cooking class with locals.
- Go on a street food tour or night market crawl.
- Attend a harvest festival or religious feast.
- Visit floating markets, fishing docks, or spice bazaars.
- Eat at a restaurant that doesn't speak your language—just point and try.
- Try plant-based local dishes—they often reflect ancient techniques and regional flavors.

## Dining Out Abroad: Tips for Getting the Best Meals (and Avoiding Common Mistakes)

Turn every meal into a cultural experience, not a tourist trap.

Eating out while traveling isn't just about feeding yourself—it's about connecting with a culture, understanding local rhythms, and creating lasting memories. But what makes a great dining experience at home doesn't always apply abroad. Here's how to eat like a local, avoid common pitfalls, and enjoy food as a central part of your bucket list journey.

### How to Find the Best, Most Authentic Meals

**Follow the Locals—Not the Guidebooks**

Avoid restaurants with English-only menus, aggressive hosts out front, or plastic food photos (unless it's a cultural norm like in Japan).

Look for places with:

- Long lines of locals
- Daily changing menus
- Limited seating or family-run vibes

Tip: Walk a few blocks away from main attractions—often that's where the good food lives.

**Use the Right Apps for Local Picks**

Try TheFork, Google Maps reviews, Tripadvisor forums, or local apps like HappyCow (for veg options) or OpenRice (Asia).

Use Instagram or TikTok with hashtags in the local language—you'll find hidden gems locals are proud to share.

**Ask Real People**

Hotel staff, bartenders, taxi drivers, or even shopkeepers will often point you to lesser-known spots they actually eat at.

Phrase your question like:
"Where would you take someone from out of town to impress them?" or
"Where's your favorite cheap local meal?"

### How to Avoid Common Pitfalls

**Don't Assume Familiar Words Mean Familiar Food**

A "pizza" in Japan or Argentina may surprise you. "Tortilla" in Spain ≠ Mexico. "Pudding" in the UK is often savory or meat-based.

When in doubt, ask what ingredients are inside—even if the name sounds familiar.

**Be Cautious with Water and Raw Foods**

In some countries, stick to bottled or filtered water (including for brushing teeth).

Avoid ice cubes, raw vegetables, or shellfish unless you're confident in the source.

If trying street food, choose vendors with:

- High turnover (fresh food)
- Locals eating there
- Food cooked hot in front of you

**Utensil Use Isn't Universal**

In many cultures, eating with hands is traditional and respectful (India, Ethiopia, parts of the Middle East).

If utensils are provided, follow suit. Otherwise, wash hands and go with the flow—it's part of the experience.

### Smart Dining Etiquette Tips by Culture

**France:**

- Don't rush—meals are an experience.
- Wait to be seated and don't ask for separate checks unless it's a casual place.
- Say "Bonjour" when entering and "Merci, au revoir" when leaving.

**Japan:**

- Slurping noodles is okay—but tipping is not.
- Place money in the tray, not directly in someone's hand.
- If eating sushi, don't mix wasabi into soy sauce unless it's already done by the chef.

**Mexico:**

- Street food is king—go for it!
- Don't be surprised if meals start later than expected—especially dinner.
- Leaving a small tip in cash is appreciated, even if not expected.

**Italy:**

- It's rare to split bills or customize dishes.
- Bread and water are usually charged separately.
- Cappuccino after lunch = tourist giveaway. Italians drink espresso after meals.

### Other Unique Tips You Might Not Think Of

**Understand Meal Times**

- In Spain, dinner might not start until 9:00 PM.
- In Argentina, eating at 11:00 PM is normal.
- Lunch may be the biggest meal of the day in many countries—plan your appetite accordingly.

**Watch for Extra Charges**

- In Italy and Portugal, a coperto (cover charge) may appear on your bill—it's not a scam, it's normal.
- In France, service charge is often included—check for "service compris."
- Be wary of "menu touristico" or pre-set menus with inflated prices near landmarks.

**Solo Travelers: Sit at the Bar or Counter**

- It's often easier and more socially acceptable than taking up a whole table.
- In places like Japan, counter service is the cultural norm.

**Food Photos: Ask First**

- Many places are fine with it—but in formal or high-end restaurants, photographing food can feel disrespectful.
- Also, don't rearrange dishes dramatically—it's a sign you're not there to eat but to perform.

## Dining at Michelin-Starred & Specialty Restaurants

Elevated meals, intentional moments, and once-in-a-lifetime flavors.

Whether you're dining at a three-Michelin-star restaurant in Paris, a 12-seat sushi bar in Tokyo, or a hidden tasting kitchen in Peru, these culinary experiences are often as much performance and art as they are meals. With the right preparation, attitude, and awareness, you can make the most of every course—and every minute.

### What Makes a Restaurant "Michelin-Starred"?

Michelin Stars are awarded (from 1 to 3) by anonymous inspectors from the Michelin Guide.

⭐ **One Star** = A very good restaurant in its category

⭐⭐ **Two Stars** = Excellent cooking, worth a detour

⭐⭐⭐ **Three Stars** = Exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey

Stars are based on food quality, consistency, technique, creativity, and the chef's personality—not ambiance or service alone.

Other specialty restaurants may not have stars but offer world-renowned dining, such as: San Pellegrino's World's 50 Best Restaurants, James Beard Award winners, Chef's Table–style experiential dining

### Before You Go: Planning & Reservations

**Book Far in Advance:** Some top-tier restaurants open reservations 1–3 months ahead or even longer, especially on a specific day at a specific time.

Use sites like: Tock, Resy, SevenRooms, Michelin Guide.

For highly coveted spots like Noma, Osteria Francescana, or Sukiyabashi Jiro, join newsletters and mark your calendar!

**Email or Call for Special Requests:** Dietary restrictions? Celebrating something special? Let them know early.

Some places don't allow substitutions, so give notice to avoid issues on-site.

### What to Wear & How to Show Up for Dinning

While dress codes vary, smart casual to formal attire is safest.

- No sneakers, shorts, or hats.
- Men: Collared shirt, closed-toe shoes.
- Women: Dresses, blouses, or upscale separates.

**Be On Time—or Early**

Many Michelin-starred restaurants run like theater productions with scheduled seatings.

Arrive 10–15 minutes early to enjoy the atmosphere and avoid delays (some places won't seat late arrivals).

### During the Meal: Etiquette & Enjoyment

**Trust the Tasting Menu:** Most offer pre-set courses with optional wine pairings.

You're there to experience the chef's vision, not yours and this may seem contrary to your usual restaurant protocol. Don't ask for major changes off the menu unless medically necessary. Ordering a steak "well-done" may be refused by the chef.

Ask questions—staff are trained to share the story behind each dish.

**Consider the Wine Pairing:** Pairings are curated to elevate the entire sensory experience.

If you're unsure, ask the sommelier for a single pairing or opt for a bottle that matches several courses.

**Respect Phone Etiquette:** Keep your phone on silent and avoid talking or scrolling at the table.

Photos are usually allowed, but no flash or rearranging plates.

Be discreet—live-streaming or vlogging is frowned upon in fine dining settings.

### Payment, Tipping & Afterthoughts

**Know the Cost Ahead of Time**

Some menus are pre-paid, especially via Tock or chef's counters.

Others may charge hundreds per person, not including wine.

Check the cancellation policy—some charge for no-shows or late changes.

### How to Get the Most Out of the Experience

**Do a Little Homework**

Learn about the chef, the restaurant philosophy, or the ingredients—it helps you appreciate the story on your plate.

Watch an episode of Chef's Table or read the restaurant's press page.

**Talk to the Staff**

Ask thoughtful questions—about flavors, sourcing, or techniques. Staff often love sharing insight (and may send a surprise your way).

Compliment specific things, like a pairing or dish balance—it shows you're engaged.

**Be Present & Savor**

Don't rush. Enjoy the pace, transitions, artistry, and emotion of the meal.

You're not just eating—you're experiencing a narrative told through food.

### What Is a Chef's Table?

A Chef's Table is a private or semi-private table situated:

- Inside the kitchen itself, or
- In a special space with full visibility into the kitchen

Offering diners a behind-the-scenes, up-close experience of the culinary process—often with a custom tasting menu, direct interaction with the chef or sous-chef, and real-time explanations of techniques, plating, and ingredients.

Some offer multi-course meals with wine pairings

Others are more interactive or casual, especially in open-kitchen restaurants

Some are available for solo travelers, but many require 2–6 guests minimum

**Why It's a Bucket List Dining Experience:**

You're eating in the heart of the action—with sights, sounds, and aromas swirling around you.

Often not listed on the regular reservation platform—it must be requested in advance.

Ideal for special occasions, food lovers, or travelers wanting a once-in-a-lifetime meal.

## Trying Cultural Meals at Luaus, Festivals & Ritual Events

When food becomes tradition—and tradition becomes the experience.

Participating in traditional or ceremonial meals offers a deep window into a culture's heart. Whether you're sitting on mats at a Hawaiian luau, sharing a meal after a Balinese temple offering, or standing in a crowded street market during a New Year celebration—these are the moments that make travel unforgettable.

### Unique Tips for Experiencing Cultural Meals Authentically

**Learn the "Why" Before You Eat**

Ask or read up on what the event celebrates or commemorates.

- A luau isn't just a party—it's a feast that honors milestones and community unity.
- A Balinese temple meal often follows rituals of offering and purification.
- In Ethiopia, sharing injera and wat from one plate symbolizes trust and kinship.

Understanding the purpose behind the meal helps you eat more mindfully and respectfully.

**Observe First, Participate Second**

At ceremonial meals, it's polite to:

- Wait until locals begin eating or give the cue.
- Watch how others use their hands or utensils.
- Sit, gesture, and speak at appropriate volumes.

Example: In many Muslim cultures, you wait until prayers or blessings are finished before eating—even if food is served.

**Don't Decline Food Too Quickly**

In many cultures, refusing food is seen as disrespectful, even if you're full or unsure about the dish.

Tip: If you're hesitant, accept a small portion, smile, and say you'll try just a little. You're honoring the host, not committing to a full plate.

Be open—you might surprise yourself by loving something that looked unfamiliar!

**Ask About Preparation Methods**

You might witness non-traditional techniques like:

- A whole pig being cooked in an underground imu pit at a luau.
- Rice cakes steamed in banana leaves during Southeast Asian festivals.
- Ritual food being hand-prepared by monks or elders.

Asking about the cooking process shows curiosity and respect—and usually earns warm smiles and deeper stories.

**Pack Essentials for Festival or Outdoor Feasts**

Bring or wear:

- Hand sanitizer and tissues (not always provided)
- A reusable water bottle
- Comfortable shoes and sun protection for standing events
- An open mind and adventurous palate

**Participate in the Meal Beyond Eating**

At many traditional events, guests may be invited to:

- Help serve food, especially in villages or at family celebrations.
- Join pre-meal blessings or dances, like in luaus or harvest rituals.
- Learn to prepare a part of the dish, such as pounding poi or stuffing tamales.

These moments are rich in connection and cultural learning—say yes if you're comfortable!

**Try What's Rare or Ritualistic**

Every culture has symbolic or rare dishes only served on special occasions.

Examples:

- Poi and lau lau in Hawaii (often only made for luaus)
- Tamales for Day of the Dead in Mexico
- Koliva at Orthodox memorial meals
- Tsoureki (braided bread) during Greek Easter
- Lamb or goat during Eid or Passover

Ask which foods are ritualistic vs. everyday—locals are often proud to share these distinctions.

**Offer Something in Return When Appropriate**

In intimate gatherings or smaller festivals:

- Bring a small gift (like fruit, sweets, or something from your home country)
- Compliment the cook or host, or learn how to say "thank you" in their language
- Help clean up or serve others—this shows deep respect in many communal cultures

**Remember That Hospitality May Be Sacred**

In many cultures, food is not just nourishment—it's a moral or spiritual obligation:

- A stranger is a guest of the gods in many Hindu and Buddhist traditions.
- In Islam, offering food during Ramadan or Eid is a form of charity and reverence.
- In Polynesian culture, sharing food is a sign of mana (spiritual strength) and community.

## Global Utensils & Eating Tools Beyond Chopsticks and Western Cutlery

The way people eat reflects how they live, cook, and connect.

### Hands / Fingers

**Where:** India, Ethiopia, Middle East, parts of Africa and Southeast Asia

**How:** Clean hands (usually the right hand only) are used to pinch, scoop, or tear food—often with flatbread, rice, or dough-based dishes.

**Etiquette Tip:**

- Right hand = clean/eating, left hand = unclean in many cultures (used for hygiene tasks).
- Handwashing before and after is often part of the ritual of the meal.
- Use fingertips, not whole hands, and never lick fingers in public settings.

### Bread as Utensil

**Where:** Middle East, Mediterranean, Ethiopia, India

**How:** Breads like injera (Ethiopia), naan (India), or pita (Middle East) are used to scoop up food instead of forks or spoons.

**Cultural Note:** Breaking bread and sharing from the same dish often symbolizes trust, hospitality, and kinship.

### Sporks & Splayds

**Where:** Popularized in the West, camping cultures, Australia

**What:** Hybrid tools that combine features of spoons, forks, and sometimes knives

**Used for:** Efficiency, outdoor eating, or minimalist dining setups

**Fun Fact:** The splayd, invented in Australia, is used at barbecues and informal gatherings.

### Korean Spoon & Chopsticks (Sujeo)

**Where:** Korea

**How:** Long-handled metal spoon for rice, stews, and soups, plus flat metal chopsticks for side dishes

**Cultural Note:**

- It's considered rude to pick up your rice bowl while eating, unlike in Japan or China.
- Utensils are often rested on the table, not left in the bowl.

### Ladle-Style Spoons

**Where:** Vietnam, China, Thailand, and many Southeast Asian countries

**Used for:** Broths, noodle soups (like pho or ramen), or rice porridges

**Shape:** Flat-bottomed, often ceramic, short-handled spoons

**Etiquette Tip:** In Japan, drink from the bowl directly and use the spoon only for toppings or broth sipping.

### Banana Leaves, Lotus Leaves, or Bark Plates

**Where:** India, Sri Lanka, parts of Africa, and Southeast Asia

**What:** Food is served and eaten off natural, biodegradable materials—often with hands

**Why:** Tradition, availability, flavor infusion, and sustainability

**Note:** This is especially common during festivals, religious ceremonies, or village feasts.

### Wooden Utensils & Coconut Spoons

**Where:** Pacific Islands, Indonesia, parts of Africa and Latin America

**Used for:** Everyday meals or ceremonial foods

**Made from:** Local materials like coconut shell, bamboo, or carved hardwood

**Symbolism:** Often used in communal or ancestral meals where modern cutlery may be avoided out of respect.

### Daggers or Small Eating Knives

**Where:** Historical Europe, nomadic groups, traditional Middle East

**How:** Used to cut meat or scoop directly into the mouth—still used in some ceremonial meals or traditional banquets

**Modern Equivalents:** Shepherd's knife, used with bread or cheese in rural cultures.

### Skewers & Sticks

**Where:** Turkey, Middle East, Southeast Asia, East Africa

**Used for:** Grilled meats (like satay, kebabs, or yakitori) and street foods

**Etiquette Tip:** In Japan and Korea, don't pass food directly from skewer to skewer—it mimics a funeral ritual.

### Coconut Shell Bowls, Gourds & Hollowed Roots

**Where:** Amazon Basin, Africa, Polynesia

**How:** Used for soups, fermented drinks (like chicha), or ceremonial foods

Often beautifully carved or naturally shaped

Still widely used in eco-tourism and indigenous communities

## Beverages & Tastings: Tips for Visiting Vineyards, Breweries & Distilleries

Where culture, craftsmanship, and flavor come together—one sip at a time.

Tasting local wines, beers, and spirits isn't just about drinking—it's about learning how regions celebrate flavor, tradition, and gathering. These experiences let you see behind the scenes, engage the senses, and savor the moment with intention. Here's how to do it right—and make the most of every tasting.

### Visiting Vineyards & Wineries

**Before You Go:**

Make a reservation. Many vineyards require advance bookings, especially for private tours or limited group tastings.

Research if the winery offers:

- Guided tastings
- Food pairings or picnic options
- Harvest or bottling participation (great in fall)

**While You're There:**

Dress appropriately: vineyards can involve walking on gravel or fields—wear comfortable shoes.

Don't overdo perfume or cologne—it interferes with wine aromas.

If tasting multiple wines, start light (whites) to bold (reds).

Feel free to spit or pour out—it's common practice, not rude.

**Extra Tips:**

Ask about local varietals—you might discover something beyond Chardonnay or Cabernet.

Bring a journal or app to note favorites.

Ask about shipping options or travel-safe packaging if purchasing bottles.

**Bucket List Angle:**

Add vineyard experiences like:

- Harvest participation in Tuscany or Napa
- Ice wine tasting in Canada
- Volcanic soil wine tours in Santorini
- Underground wine cellars in Hungary or Champagne, France

### Visiting Breweries (Craft & Historic)

**Before You Go:**

Check if the brewery offers guided tours—some are factory-style, others are hands-on with brewers.

Look into flight tastings, where you try 3–6 small pours.

**While You're There:**

Ask about seasonal or small-batch brews not available elsewhere.

Learn about the brewing method: lagers, IPAs, sours, stouts, and what makes them different.

Bring your own reusable bottle carrier or growler if you plan to buy on-site.

**Extra Tips:**

In some countries (like Belgium), beers have their own specific glasses—learn why and how that affects the experience.

Eat a snack before or during to stay balanced—many breweries have food pairings or food trucks.

**Bucket List Angle:**

Try specialty tours like:

- Trappist monastery breweries in Belgium
- Hop farm tours in Oregon or New Zealand
- Beer spas in Czech Republic
- Underground beer cellars in Germany
- The Guinness Storehouse in Dublin, Ireland was named Europe's Leading Tourist Attraction in 2023 by the World Travel Awards, beating out Buckingham Palace and the Eiffel Tower.

### Visiting Distilleries (Spirits & Specialty Liqueurs)

**Before You Go:**

Many distilleries (especially whiskey, rum, or mezcal producers) require you to book a tour in advance.

Be aware that tasting pours may be stronger than wine or beer flights—pace yourself accordingly.

**While You're There:**

Ask about aged vs. unaged spirits, barrels used, and the distilling process.

Learn the "nose" and "finish"—smelling and identifying flavor notes.

Don't be afraid to say it's too strong—distilleries are about education, not just consumption.

**Extra Tips:**

Bring water and neutral snacks (crackers, bread) to reset your palate.

Take photos of bottles and labels you love—especially if they're local-only.

Buy direct from the source if the spirit isn't exported widely.

**Bucket List Angle:**

Add these unique experiences:

- Tequila trail tour in Jalisco, Mexico
- Scotch whisky trail in the Scottish Highlands
- Cognac house visits in France
- Artisanal mezcal producers in Oaxaca
- Japanese whisky tastings near Mt. Fuji

### Global & Cultural Considerations

Legal drinking age varies by country—check local laws.

Never assume tasting = all-you-can-drink. Many cultures emphasize moderation and savoring.

Dress with modesty and respect, especially in religious or conservative countries where alcohol is rare or restricted.

In some places, tasting etiquette includes toasting or blessing the host—ask what's customary.

**Never-ever drink and drive!** Legal blood-alcohol levels and penalties vary and can be very severe and harsh in a foreign environment.
