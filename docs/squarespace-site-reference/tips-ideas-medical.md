## General Medical Advice for Bucket List Travel

### General Medical Advice

Your health is the foundation for everything on your bucket list journey, especially when traveling. By planning ahead, bringing the right medications, and knowing your medical needs, you can enjoy your trip with peace of mind. Don't wait until you're in a foreign country to realize something important is missing—prep now for the safest, most stress-free travel experience possible.

## Meet with Your Doctor(s) Before You Travel

Before you book the zipline, the hike, or even the plane ticket—schedule a visit with your primary care physician (and any specialists you see regularly). Here's what to cover:

### Get Medical Clearance for Travel or Activities

Ask if you're medically cleared for long flights, high altitudes, scuba diving, strenuous excursions, or travel to remote areas.

Discuss how chronic conditions (like heart disease, diabetes, asthma, or autoimmune disorders) may be affected by your destination's climate, altitude, or stressors.

If needed, ask for documentation that supports your fitness to travel—some tour operators, insurance plans, or visa applications may require it.

### Ask for Travel-Specific Medical Advice

What risks exist at your destination? Your doctor can advise on infectious diseases, food/water safety, or environmental hazards based on your itinerary.

Are there activities you should avoid or modify? If you're planning to climb, dive, ride animals, or trek, your doctor may recommend limits or alternatives.

### Get the Right Vaccinations and Preventive Medications

Schedule this at least 4–6 weeks before departure so you have time to complete any series of shots or allow immunity to build.

Ask about:

Routine updates (tetanus, MMR, flu, shingles, etc.)

Destination-specific vaccines (yellow fever, typhoid, hepatitis A/B, Japanese encephalitis)

Preventive prescriptions, like:

- Malaria medication for tropical regions
- Traveler's diarrhea meds (Ciprofloxacin or azithromycin)
- Altitude sickness pills (Acetazolamide) if you're going above 8,000 ft
- Antivirals if there's known regional risk (like dengue or flu)

Make sure your vaccination records are accessible and up-to-date, especially if your destination requires proof (like yellow fever zones or post-COVID protocols).

## Over-the-Counter (OTC) Medications & Supplements to Bring

Always check with your healthcare provider if you're unsure about the use of over-the-counter medications or supplements.

**Pain Relief & Fever Medication:** Always pack basic pain relief (ibuprofen, aspirin, or acetaminophen) for headaches, sore muscles, or fever.

**Allergy Medication:** Carry antihistamines (like Benadryl, Claritin, or Zyrtec) to manage seasonal allergies or allergic reactions to foods, insect stings, or environmental factors.

**Cold & Flu Relief:** A cold remedy, cough syrup, nasal spray, or throat lozenges can help if you start feeling unwell.

**Stomach Medications:** Pack antacids, anti-nausea medication (like Pepto-Bismol), and anti-diarrheal meds like Imodium.

**Topical Creams & Ointments:** Bring a basic antiseptic (like Neosporin), hydrocortisone cream, and sunscreen.

**Motion Sickness Medication:** For those prone to nausea on planes, buses, or boats, Dramamine or Bonine can be lifesavers.

### Supplements to Consider:

**Probiotics:** To support digestion, especially when trying new foods.

**Vitamins:** Bring vitamin C, multivitamins, and any other necessary supplements to maintain your immunity and energy while traveling.

**Electrolytes:** Pack electrolyte tablets or hydration powders (like Pedialyte or Nuun) to stay hydrated, particularly in warmer climates.

## Medical Documentation for Prescription Medications

**Carry Original Prescriptions:** Always bring your medications in their original packaging with the prescription label visible, especially for controlled substances.

**Doctor's Letter:** For medications that are controlled (e.g., stimulants, painkillers, or injectables), carry a letter from your doctor explaining the medical need, dosage, and condition being treated.

**International Travel & Medication Laws:** Check if any of your prescriptions are restricted in the country you're visiting. Certain medications, such as ADHD medications or some painkillers, are illegal in countries like the UAE and Japan.

## Immunization Records & Health Certifications

**Travel Vaccinations:** Ensure you're up-to-date on routine vaccinations (MMR, flu, etc.), and check if any travel-specific vaccines are required or recommended for your destination (e.g., Yellow Fever, Typhoid, Hepatitis A/B).

**Current Outbreaks:** At times the world may suffer certain contagious outbreaks such as the occurrence of COVID-19. During these periods, many destinations may require proof of specific vaccinations or a negative test result for entry. Always check country-specific requirements during these periods.

**Yellow Fever Certificate:** Some countries in Africa or South America require proof of Yellow Fever vaccination before entry. Keep the Yellow Card with you at all times.

## Medical Conditions & Emergency Instructions

**List of Medical Conditions:** Create a document or app-based list that outlines any chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, asthma, heart disease), allergies, or previous surgeries. This should also include any medications you're taking and their dosage.

**Emergency Contacts:** Include the contact details of your primary doctor, any specialists, and emergency contacts back home. Have this information both digitally (secure storage) and printed in case of emergencies.

**Allergy Alerts:** If you have allergies (especially food or insect allergies), wear a medical bracelet and carry a list of allergies in both your native language and the language of the country you're visiting.

**Know Your Destination's Medical Emergency Protocol:** Familiarize yourself with emergency numbers, nearest hospitals, and any local medical customs before you travel (e.g., health insurance requirements in some countries).

## Traveling with Physical Disabilities or Limitations

### General Considerations:

**Notify Airlines in Advance:** When booking flights, request early boarding and any necessary assistance (e.g., wheelchair service, assistance with mobility devices). Airlines may typically require at least 48 hours' notice.

**Accessibility at Airports:** Many airports now have designated accessible services, including ramps, elevators, and priority seating at security and gate areas. Check airport websites or apps to plan your journey through the airport.

**Medical Equipment Needs:** If traveling with medical equipment (e.g., oxygen concentrators, CPAP machines, home dialysis units), ensure your airline is notified, and ask about any special requirements for carrying or using them during the flight.

**Accessible Accommodation:** Hotels, resorts and cruises may offer accessible rooms with features like wide doors, roll-in showers, and handrails. Confirm these features at the time of booking.

### Specific Disabilities Considerations:

**Mobility Impairments:** If using a wheelchair or mobility device, research wheelchair-friendly tours, buses, and taxis at your destination. Consider renting a mobility scooter for local travel.

**Hearing Impairments:** Look into accommodations like captioning, visual or vibrating alarms, or sign language interpreters available in public spaces or through private services.

**Vision Impairments:** Many tourist attractions offer audio tours or braille signage. Contact venues in advance to confirm availability.

## Traveling with Diabetes: Special Considerations

Whether you're managing type 1 or type 2 diabetes, it's absolutely possible to travel confidently—but it requires extra preparation. Climate, food, physical activity, and time zones can all affect your blood sugar. Here's what to do before, during, and after travel to stay safe while enjoying your trip to the fullest.

### Before You Travel

**Visit Your Healthcare Provider:** Get medical clearance if your trip includes strenuous activity, altitude, or remote areas. Ask for an up-to-date prescription list (insulin, oral meds, syringes, etc.), a doctor's letter explaining your condition, devices, and medical needs, advice on managing time zone shifts with insulin or medication schedules and guidance on adjusting insulin for increased activity, altitude, or temperature

**Arrange Travel Insurance That Covers Diabetes:** Choose a plan that includes emergency evacuation, hospital care, and pre-existing conditions. Ensure it covers lost or stolen medication/devices.

**Notify Your Airline or Cruise Line:** Request early boarding if needed, and ask about refrigeration or electrical outlets for devices. If using an insulin pump or continuous glucose monitor (CGM), alert security and bring documentation to avoid issues at checkpoints.

**Double Your Supplies:** Bring twice as much insulin, test strips, and CGM sensors as you think you'll need.

**Keep All Medications in Your Carry-On:** Never check insulin or meters—baggage delays can be dangerous.

**Get an Insulin Cooling Case or Frio Bag:** Essential for warm climates or long travel days without refrigeration.

**Glucose Tablets or Fast-Acting Sugar:** Keep these with you at all times—in pockets, daypacks, and your travel wallet.

**Snacks for Delays or Skipped Meals:** Pack protein-rich or carb-balanced snacks like nuts, granola bars, or cheese sticks.

**Sharps Container or Needle Disposal Plan:** Bring a small travel version or ask the hotel/cruise staff how to dispose safely.

### On the Trip

**Watch for Hidden Sugar in Local Foods:** Even small differences in sauces or drinks can impact blood sugar. When in doubt, go slow and test more frequently.

**Adjust for Activity and Climate:** More walking or heat may lower blood sugar faster—carry glucose and test often.

**Label Your Gear Clearly:** Insulin, pens, and devices should be marked and easy for others to identify in an emergency.

**Store Emergency Info in Your Wallet & Phone:** Include diagnosis, meds, allergies, and emergency contacts.

**Wear a Medical ID Bracelet:** It should say "Diabetes – Insulin Dependent" (if applicable) and your emergency contact info.

### Airports & Security Tips

Inform TSA or Security Agents about your pump, pen, or CGM before screening.

You have the right to:

- Request a visual inspection of supplies instead of X-ray
- Refuse to remove your medical device
- Carry sharps, insulin, and liquids above 3.4 oz, with proper labeling

Living with diabetes doesn't mean compromising your dreams. It means planning intentionally so that your condition doesn't dictate your trip—you do. With the right preparation, your bucket list is still wide open.

## Traveling with Mental Health Conditions

### Mental Health Medication & Documentation

**Keep Medications Accessible:** Mental health medications, especially for anxiety, depression, or sleep disorders, should be in your carry-on luggage, along with documentation of the prescriptions and a doctor's note.

**Know the Mental Health Resources at Your Destination:** Research mental health resources available in the area (such as clinics, support groups, or hotlines) in case of a crisis.

**Travel Insurance with Mental Health Coverage:** Make sure your travel insurance covers mental health emergencies, including coverage for inpatient care if needed.

### Coping Strategies for Anxiety, Stress, and Other Concerns

**Pre-Flight Relaxation Techniques:** Use deep-breathing exercises, guided meditation, or calming music apps to manage pre-flight anxiety or fear of flying.

**Jet Lag Management:** For those with anxiety or sleep disorders, ensure you bring sleep aids (melatonin, CBD, etc.) that are safe and legal at your destination.

**Routine & Familiar Comforts:** Try to maintain some of your routines while traveling, like taking walks, eating familiar foods, or staying connected with loved ones, to minimize disruptions to your mental health.

**Notify Your Mental Health Providers of Your Travel:** If you have a psychiatrist, psychotherapist or other mental health provider, notify them of your travel destination and duration. Ask for any advice and have their emergency contact numbers with you and ask about their availability in case of an emergency.

## Physically Training/Preparing for Your Trip

Condition your body for adventure—so you can enjoy every moment.

The best memories happen when your body feels strong enough to keep up with your spirit. Training doesn't have to be intense—but it should be intentional. Start prepping at least 4–6 weeks before your trip, depending on the demands of your destination.

### Start with Your Itinerary:

Ask yourself:

- How much walking or standing will I do daily?
- Will there be stairs, hills, or high altitudes?
- Will I be swimming, biking, paddling, or climbing?
- Am I carrying luggage, a daypack, or equipment?
- Am I trying something physically new (diving, skiing, horseback riding)?

Then match your prep to your plans.

### Physical Prep by Type of Trip:

**Urban/City Trips**

Think: walking tours, museums, local transit

- Take daily 30–60 min walks, ideally on uneven surfaces or stairs.
- Strengthen your feet, calves, and lower back—you'll be on them all day.
- Break in your travel shoes ahead of time.

**Hiking, Trekking & Elevation Trips**

Think: Machu Picchu, Alps, Patagonia

- Add hill or stair climbing into your routine.
- Build leg and core strength (squats, lunges, planks).
- Practice walking with a loaded daypack and trekking poles.
- Train with longer hikes on weekends, building up your endurance.
- If elevation is a factor, consult your doctor about acclimatization or altitude meds.

**Adventure & Water-Based Travel**

Think: kayaking, snorkeling, SCUBA, rafting

- Build upper body and grip strength for paddling or gear handling.
- Practice swimming or treading water if it's been a while.
- Add yoga or stretching for balance and joint health—especially for getting in/out of boats.

**Wilderness & Remote Destinations**

Think: National parks, safaris, desert travel

- Train with uneven terrain or weighted hiking and trekking poles.
- Practice early morning or midday movement—these trips often start early or go into heat.
- Learn basic bodyweight recovery stretches—you may not have gym access.

**All-Inclusive or Cruise Trips**

Even low-activity trips involve walking through large ports or airports, dancing, excursions, or climbing stairs on the ship.

- Walking and light cardio will improve stamina and reduce post-travel fatigue.
- Strengthen your balance and coordination to avoid falls on moving ships or unfamiliar floors.

### Pro Tips:

- Don't overtrain right before your trip. Focus on gradual improvement, not burnout.
- Stretch daily—flexibility prevents soreness and improves recovery between long days.
- Simulate your day: Wear your pack while walking. Test your gear. Try hiking in your travel shoes.
- Get a Smart Watch or Fitness Monitor: As you train, monitor your heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, distance walked, stairs climbed and other fitness parameters to measure your training progress and preparedness for your trip.
- If traveling with limitations: Speak with a physical therapist about trip-specific prep that works for your mobility level or condition.

## Travel Considerations for Plus-Size and Obese Travelers

A bucket list is for every body and travel is for every body—and with the right preparation, it can be more comfortable, accessible, and joyful. Larger-bodied travelers often face barriers that others don't even have to think about—from cramped airplane seats to mobility challenges, or fear of judgment in active excursions. But none of these things should keep someone from exploring the world. The key is anticipating your needs and advocating for your comfort.

### Before You Fly

**Know Your Airline's Seat Policies:** Some airlines require passengers who don't fit within one seat with the armrests down to purchase a second seat—others offer a refund or a free extra seat (like Southwest). Research in advance.

**Request a Seatbelt Extender:**
You can ask discreetly when boarding or bring your own FAA-approved extender. Flight attendants are used to this—don't feel embarrassed. They have them for a reason and you are not the only person who uses them.

**Book Seats Strategically:**

- Aisle seats can offer more room to stretch one leg and move more freely.
- Bulkhead and exit rows sometimes offer more space, but exit rows have restrictions.
- If you can afford first class or business class these seats are wider and more comfortable.

**Board Early if You Can:** Pre-boarding allows time to get settled, find space for bags, and avoid narrow aisles packed with people.

### General Travel & Packing Tips

**Pack Lightweight, Comfortable Clothing:** Fabrics like cotton, modal, or linen reduce chafing and heat retention. Compression shorts under dresses or loose pants prevent thigh chafing.

**Bring Personal Comfort Tools:**

- Travel pillow or neck roll
- Anti-chafing balm or powder
- Foldable seat cushion or back support
- Your own towel or wrap for certain destinations or excursions

**Use Rolling or Sit-On Luggage:** Navigating long airport corridors or train stations is easier with a supportive rolling bag or a compact scooter if needed.

### Excursion & Activity Planning

**Ask About Weight Limits Before You Book:** Unfortunately, many adventure activities (zip-lining, horseback riding, paragliding, snorkeling, etc.) have weight restrictions for safety or equipment. These are not always listed online—don't hesitate to call and ask.

**Bring What You Need to Get Around:** Using walkers or hiking poles can reduce energy expenditure by over 50%. And if your more comfortable with a wheel chair or scooter, bring that too where allowed.

**Seek Size-Inclusive Outfitters:** Choose tour companies and operators that openly advertise accommodations for larger travelers (such as wider harnesses, buoyancy vests, or larger bikes).

**Advocate for Your Comfort:** It's okay to ask for larger seats, extra time to board, step-free access, or custom options. You are a paying customer and deserve to feel safe and respected.

**Choose Group Tours Wisely:** Consider smaller group tours or private excursions where pace and comfort can be adjusted to your needs.

### Accommodations & Accessibility

**Check for Sturdy Furniture and Room Layouts:** Read reviews and photos to ensure chairs, beds, and showers feel safe and comfortable.

**Ask About Shower Access:** Roll-in showers, grab bars, or removable shower heads can make a big difference for plus-size travelers with mobility needs.

**Bring a Portable Step or Shower Stool (if needed):** These small travel aids can make getting in and out of high bathtubs or tight spaces safer.

**Scooters and Ambulatory Devices:** Some hotels and most casinos offer ambulatory devices such as scooters for rent. If this can make your experience more enjoyable rent one.

### ❤️ Mental Health & Confidence Tips

**You Have a Right to Take Up Space:** Don't apologize for needing comfort or support. You're not "inconveniencing" anyone who is a decent human being.

**Plan Breaks, Not Barriers:** Fatigue is real, and that's okay. Build in rest time, choose accessible paths, and pace your day for joy—not endurance. Don't hesitate to board first, or get off last.

**Curate Your Social Circle:** Travel with people who uplift and include you. Avoid travel companions who body-shame, rush, or dismiss your comfort.
