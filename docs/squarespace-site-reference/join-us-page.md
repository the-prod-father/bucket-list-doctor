## Notes for Redesign

**Issues with current form:**
- Generic "services" and "budget" fields don't align with bucket list/newsletter focus
- Too many fields for a simple newsletter signup
- Confusing mix of contact form + newsletter signup

**Recommended improvements:**
1. Simplify to focus on newsletter signup
2. Add clear value proposition ("Get bucket list tips, neuroscience insights, and adventure ideas")
3. Optional: Separate contact form from newsletter signup
4. Modern, engaging design with bucket list imagery
5. Clear privacy/unsubscribe info
6. Integration with Supabase (already set up)
