### Introduction Text (Full Verbatim)

Hello, I'm Dr. Jeffrey DeSarbo. In this section of the website, I share some of the bucket list moments I've been fortunate enough to experience throughout my life. These stories reflect travels, adventures, events, challenges, and meaningful activities that have shaped my journey and are deeply personal to me.

Each item is part of my "bucket list life." They were chosen based on who I am: my personality, values, interests, level of risk, and sense of adventure. Some of these experiences may resonate with you, while others may not—and that's the beauty of a bucket list. It's yours. You set the rules. You decide what matters. You define the boundaries.

The purpose of this space isn't to boast or suggest that anyone should measure their life against mine. Instead, I hope to show the variety of life's offerings I have discovered and how pursuing personal goals—big or small—can bring purpose, balance, and joy, even through life's inevitable challenges.

As I share in my About Me section, I didn't come from a privileged background. I was raised in a lower-middle-class household, with few expectations placed on me growing up. Becoming a doctor was a later-in-life goal—and yes, a bucket list item. I've had both opportunities and misfortunes along the way. But I've always tried to make the most of what life has offered, striving to live without regret and to stay curious about what's possible.

Many people with far more resources than I've had have experienced less of what I call a "bucket list life." And I've met countless others with far fewer resources who have done more and inspired me with their courage, creativity, and relentless pursuit of meaningful experiences. This path is not about privilege but purpose, perspective, and personal fulfillment.

So, as you explore this section, I invite you to reflect on your own path—not in comparison, but in inspiration and motivation. Use these stories and others across this site to spark ideas, reignite passions, and remind yourself that it's never too early or too late to start living the life you imagine.
