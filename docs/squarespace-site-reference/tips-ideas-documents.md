**Important Documentation: What You Need & What People Often Forget**

Your bucket list adventure shouldn't be derailed by missing paperwork. From boarding a plane to checking into a hotel—or even renting snorkel gear—having the right documentation can make or break the experience. Here's your go-to guide for making sure you have what you need, including lesser-known documents and smart ways to keep them secure.

## Core Travel Identification Tips

**Check Your Passport's Expiry Date (Right Now):** Many countries require that your passport be valid for at least 6 months beyond your return date. Don't assume you're okay just because it hasn't expired yet.

**Make Sure Your Name Matches Exactly:** Your airline ticket and passport (or ID) must match letter for letter. This includes middle names or hyphenations—otherwise, you may be denied boarding.

**Carry a Backup Government ID:** A second form of ID (driver's license, national ID card) can be helpful if your passport is lost or you need to prove identity domestically.

**Check Entry Rules for Every Country:** Some countries allow visa-free entry, some require electronic visas (e-visas), and others require you to apply weeks in advance. Always check the official government immigration site—not just blogs or forums.

## Lesser-Known but Sometimes Crucial Documentation

**Proof of Travel Insurance:** Some countries require printed proof of travel health insurance (especially during health emergencies or pandemics).

**Vaccination Records or Health Certificates:** Yellow fever, polio, and COVID-related documentation may still be required in certain regions.

**International Driving Permit (IDP):** Needed in many countries even if you have a valid license. Without it, your car rental may be denied—even after you've booked and paid.

**Letter of Consent for Minors:** If you're traveling with children who are not your own (or one parent is absent), many border officials require a notarized letter of permission.

**Credit Card Authorization Letters:** If you're using someone else's credit card for a hotel or rental car booking, some providers may require a written letter and ID copy from the cardholder.

**Proof of Funds or Exit Ticket:** Countries like Thailand or Peru may ask for proof you can financially support yourself—or proof you'll leave before your visa expires (a return or onward ticket).

**Cruise-Specific Docs:** Some cruises require special shore passes, visas for port countries (even if you're not staying overnight), or customs declarations for duty-free goods.

**Proof of Onward Travel:** Countries like Costa Rica, Indonesia, and the Philippines may require documentation showing when—and how—you plan to leave.

## Backup, Backup, Backup

**Take Photos or Scans of Everything:** Before your trip, photograph or scan your passport, ID, tickets, insurance, vaccination card, and important bookings. Save them in multiple locations:

- Your phone (in a secure folder)
- Cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud)
- Email them to yourself

**Carry Printed Copies:** In areas with poor cell service or when devices die, paper copies can save the day. Keep them in a waterproof sleeve or organizer.

**Use a Travel Document Organizer:** A slim, RFID-blocking pouch keeps your passport, IDs, boarding passes, emergency contacts, and backup cards in one secure, easy-to-grab place.

**Give a Trusted Person Access:** Share key documents with someone at home (especially for solo travelers) in case of emergency.

**Label Your Passport Photocopy "COPY":** This avoids confusion or trouble with authorities if you're asked to show the real thing.

## U.S. Domestic Travel: The REAL ID

**REAL ID Is Now Required for Domestic Flights:** U.S. travelers need a REAL ID-compliant driver's license or state ID to board domestic flights and enter federal facilities.

- Look for a star in the upper right corner of your ID.
- If you don't have one, you'll need a passport or another TSA-approved ID to fly—even within the U.S.

## Documentation for Medications (Especially Controlled Substances)

**Keep Meds in Original Packaging:** Prescription labels should show your name, doctor's info, and dosage. Especially important for international travel or controlled substances like ADHD meds, painkillers, or anti-anxiety meds.

**Bring a Doctor's Note or Prescription Copy:** Especially for narcotics, stimulants, or injectable meds (like insulin or hormone therapy). A short letter explaining the need and dosage can help at customs.

**Check Medication Legality at Your Destination:** Some medications that are common in your country (e.g. Adderall or even Sudafed) are banned or restricted abroad. Check with the embassy or a travel medicine clinic before departure.

**Carry Medications in Your Carry-On:** Never check important medications—luggage can be delayed or lost.

## Documentation for Service & Emotional Support Animals

### Service Animals:

Bring documentation of training, certification, and a doctor's letter explaining the medical need.

Airlines and hotels may require advance notice and specific paperwork. Always check their policies beforehand.

### Emotional Support Animals (ESAs):

Many airlines have changed their ESA policies and no longer allow ESAs to fly in the cabin. If allowed, you'll need a letter from a licensed mental health professional, dated within 12 months.

Some destinations (including Hawaii and international ports) have strict quarantine laws for all animals. Plan months ahead if needed.

**Vaccination & Health Certificates:** Bring a recent health certificate from a vet, including proof of rabies and other required vaccinations—especially when crossing borders or going on cruises.

## Activity Certifications & Hobby-Specific Documentation

If your bucket list includes high-adventure experiences like SCUBA diving, skydiving, sailing, or mountaineering, you may need to carry proof of experience, training, or certification. Many providers require this before they'll let you participate—even if you've booked in advance.

Here's what to know:

### SCUBA Diving Certifications

Most dive shops require a certification card (physical or digital) from an accredited organization like PADI, SSI, or NAUI.

Some dives—especially deep, wreck, or cave dives—may require advanced or specialty certifications.

Lost your card? Many agencies now offer digital cards via their apps or websites. Be sure to download it before you leave.

### Skydiving Logbooks or Proof of Training

If you're licensed and planning to skydive abroad (not just tandem), you'll likely need to show:

- Your USPA license (or equivalent)
- A current logbook
- Proof of recent jumps or refresher courses

Some drop zones may require documentation to be translated or accompanied by insurance coverage.

### Sailing or Boating Licenses

In certain countries (especially in Europe), operating a sailboat, catamaran, or jet ski may require an International Certificate of Competence (ICC) or national boating license.

Chartering a boat? Some companies require a resume of your sailing experience plus your formal credentials.

### Mountaineering, Ice Climbing, or Technical Terrain

Adventure parks, glacier hikes, or alpine guides may require proof of:

- Prior course completion
- First-aid or avalanche safety training
- Experience logs or guide references

### Other Specialized Activities

**Freediving:** Often requires level-based certification and a current medical form.

**Paragliding or Hang Gliding:** Most locations require a national or international rating card.

**Motorbiking Abroad:** Some countries require a motorcycle endorsement or international motorcycle license.

**Firearms or Archery Ranges (in some countries):** May require proof of training or club affiliation.
