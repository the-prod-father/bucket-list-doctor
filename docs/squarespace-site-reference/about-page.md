### Key Points from Blog Page Intro to Include:
"I didn't come from a privileged background. I was raised in a lower-middle-class household, with few expectations placed on me growing up. Becoming a doctor was a later-in-life goal—and yes, a bucket list item. I've had both opportunities and misfortunes along the way. But I've always tried to make the most of what life has offered, striving to live without regret and to stay curious about what's possible."
