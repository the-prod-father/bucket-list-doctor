## Safety & Precautions for Bucket Listers

Because extraordinary experiences should come with smart planning.

Bucket list adventures often take you outside your comfort zone—and that's part of what makes them incredible. But whether you're skydiving, hiking remote trails, traveling solo, or exploring unfamiliar countries, your safety and preparedness should always come first. This guide is designed to help you plan wisely, assess risks, protect yourself, and know what to do when something goes wrong.

## Safety Starts with the List: Smart Bucket List Planning

### Tips When Creating Your List:

Assess your health and ability honestly before adding high-risk or strenuous activities.

Don't confuse "epic" with "reckless." Challenge yourself but be realistic about your limits.

For dangerous or remote experiences (mountain climbs, scuba diving, etc.), include "preparation milestones" like training or certifications as part of the list.

Prioritize reputable companies and licensed guides for high-risk activities.

Ask yourself: Would I be willing to do this alone? In another language? Without cell service? If not, consider modifying your goal plans and adding it with safeguards.

## Physical Risk, Dangerous Activities & Extreme Sports

### Planning & Participation Tips:

Always get medical clearance before engaging in activities such as:

- Scuba diving
- High-altitude treks
- Bungee jumping
- Skydiving
- White-water rafting

Check insurance coverage for:

- Emergency evacuation
- Hospitalization abroad
- High-risk sports (not always included in basic plans)

### Pro Tips:

Take lessons or training in advance (e.g., rock climbing, surfing, snowboarding).

Don't rely on your fitness level alone—learn safety protocols and terminology.

Always have appropriate clothing for warmth and comfort.

Be sure to have water decontamination tablets or bottles for long treks.

Ask about equipment checks and staff certifications. If they're vague—walk away.

Use a buddy system—even experienced adventurers shouldn't go it alone.

## Safety & Security While Traveling

### General Travel Safety Tips:

Share your itinerary, lodging details, and emergency contacts with someone at home.

Have a general code word agreed upon to let your contacts (family members/friends) know if you are in danger and another to let contacts know it is truly you and not an AI generated voice. Example: saying. "A.O.K.," means you're in danger. Saying, "Mommy," means it's really you and not a fake or AI voice. Saying, "I'm A.O.K. mommy," means it's really you and you're in danger.

Keep digital and physical copies of your passport, travel insurance, and key documents.

Register with your country's embassy or consulate for longer or riskier trips.

Always carry emergency cash, photo ID, copy of passport, local emergency numbers, your hotel/cruise address and phone number (in the local language if needed), backup emergency medications if needed in a pillbox.

Remain aware of your surroundings in day and at night.

Do not leave luggage, bags or personal items unattended.

Check ID of taxi drivers, Uber drivers and other transportation personnel and only use licensed companies.

## Using Satellite Phones & Messengers for Remote Bucket List Adventures

When you go off-grid, don't go silent.

Not all bucket list adventures come with cell service. Whether you're climbing Kilimanjaro, trekking Patagonia, hiking in the Canadian Rockies, or exploring Arctic ice fields, a satellite communication device can keep you connected in case of emergencies—or just for peace of mind.

### Why Satellite Communication Matters

Cell service disappears fast in national parks, high altitudes, deep canyons, deserts, oceans, and jungles.

In remote areas, satellite signals are the only reliable way to:

- Call for help during an emergency
- Stay in touch with your team or guide
- Send updates to loved ones
- Receive weather or safety alerts

Note: Some newer smartphones (like iPhone 14 and up) offer emergency satellite SOS but can have very limited availability and no regular communication features.

### Tips for Using Satellite Devices Effectively

Pre-test the device before your trip—know how to use all functions (including SOS).

Charge fully and carry extra batteries and a solar charger.

Program emergency contacts into the device before travel.

Learn how to send a location pin and how to check signal (satellites need open sky).

Rent instead of buy if it's a one-time or infrequent need—check with local outfitters or services.

### Great for These Types of Trips:

- Kilimanjaro, Everest Base Camp, or Andes trekking
- Amazon or Congo River expeditions
- Sailing, cruising beyond Wi-Fi zones, or island hopping
- Deserts (Sahara, Atacama, Mojave)
- Arctic or Antarctic tours
- Deep backcountry hikes in Canada, Alaska, Australia, or Patagonia

## Local Awareness & Cultural Sensitivity:

Research local laws and norms before traveling:

Some places ban certain medications, clothing styles, or public displays of affection.

What's a legal souvenir in one country could be contraband in another.

Don't assume local police function like they do at home. Some may expect bribes, while others may be extremely strict.

### Tips for Avoiding Theft & Scams:

Use anti-theft bags or slings, and don't carry everything in one place.

Avoid displaying valuables (cameras, jewelry, phones) in high-theft areas.

Be aware of distraction tactics (e.g., a child bumping into you while someone picks your pocket).

In markets or taxis, agree on prices up front and be wary of pressure tactics.

## Securing Money, Jewelry & Personal Belongings

### Divide and Conquer

Never keep all your valuables in one place.

Carry only what you need for the day. Lock what you can.

Keep backup cards or cash in a separate bag or location.

Leave emergency funds hidden in your luggage or hotel safe.

Act Like You Know Where You're Going. Walk with confidence—even if you're not sure.

Avoid checking your phone or maps in the middle of a street. Step into a shop or quiet corner instead.

### Smart Ways to Secure Your Money

Use a money belt, neck pouch, or hidden pocket under your clothes.

Consider an RFID-blocking wallet or anti-theft crossbody bag.

In high-theft areas, use a decoy wallet with a few small bills and expired cards.

Bring multiple cards (debit/credit) and store one separately in your luggage or hotel.

Keep a record of card numbers and contact info for cancellation in case of theft.

Notify your bank of travel dates and locations to avoid card blocks.

### The Benefits of Using Apple Pay & Digital Wallets While Traveling

**Enhanced Security**

Your actual credit or debit card number is never shared with merchants.

Every transaction uses a unique, encrypted code—making it extremely difficult to hack or skim.

Your device usually requires biometric verification (Face ID, fingerprint) before completing a payment.

**Convenience While Traveling**

No need to carry your physical wallet everywhere—less risk of theft or loss.

Great for quick transit (taps on metro gates, buses, etc.).

Works even if you're traveling light or wearing clothing without pockets.

**Widespread Global Acceptance**

Apple Pay and other wallets are accepted in:

- Most of Europe (especially Nordic countries, the UK, France, Germany)
- Many parts of Asia (Japan, China, Singapore, South Korea)
- Major cities in North America, Australia, and the Middle East
- Even if your home country doesn't use digital payments often, many foreign countries now prefer it—especially post-pandemic.

**Other Smart Benefits**

Track spending instantly through your app.

Pair with a virtual travel card or card with no foreign transaction fees.

Some digital wallets offer built-in currency conversion tools.

Easier refunds or reimbursements if something goes wrong.

**Important Notes & Tips**

Bring a backup physical card in case the system goes down or a small vendor only takes cash.

Not all countries accept Apple Pay yet—check local compatibility before you go.

Have at least one form of ID and one physical payment method on you at all times.

Use Apple Maps or Google Maps to filter or search for "Apple Pay accepted here" businesses in some cities.

Carry a portable battery charger in case your cell phone power turns off.

### Traveling with Jewelry & Valuables

**Best Practices:**

Leave expensive or sentimental jewelry at home unless it's essential (e.g., wedding band).

If traveling with valuables:

- Do not make yourself a target. Wear simple, understated pieces.
- Store them in a mini combination safe or lockbox inside your main luggage.
- Don't store jewelry in checked luggage.

If you must bring valuable items, consider getting them insured for travel.

If traveling with very valuable pieces consider using the hotel's main safe or secure deposit box at the front desk if available. Access often requires a key from both you and staff, offering dual protection. Typically monitored by security staff or surveillance and often insured by the hotel.

On Cruise Ships: Keep highly valuable items with the Purser or Guest Services which typically has a secured vault or safe deposit boxes available for passenger use.

### Securing Passports & Documents

**What to Carry:**

Carry a laminated copy of your passport photo page (and visa, if applicable).

Keep originals in a hotel safe, unless you're in a country that requires ID at all times.

Store a digital scan of documents in a secure cloud folder (Google Drive, Dropbox, or encrypted apps).

**Emergency Prep:**

Include copies of passport, travel insurance, medical prescriptions. credit/debit card numbers (last 4 digits only), emergency contact list

## Safety at Accommodations

### In-Room Safety:

Use the hotel/cruise cabin safe if available—but also:

- Check if the safe works before storing valuables.
- Use a personal lockable pouch or mini safe if safes are not provided.
- Don't leave valuables out, even in "nice" hotels.

### Room Entry Protection:

Use a portable door lock or doorstop alarm, especially in shared or low-security lodging.

Always lock doors and windows, even if you're only stepping out briefly.

Leave the television on so room sounds occupied.

## Luggage & Transit Safety

### While Flying or in Transit:

Keep valuables in your carry-on, not checked baggage.

Use a lockable, hard-shell suitcase for protection against theft and tampering.

Add a luggage tracker (e.g., Apple AirTag, Tile) to keep tabs on bags.

### On Buses or Trains:

Keep your bag in front of you, not in overhead bins or at your feet.

Use a carabiner clip to attach zippers for basic deterrence.

If sleeping on a train or overnight bus, use your bag as a pillow or loop your arm through the strap.

### If Theft Happens

**What to Do:**

Firstly, be prepared by following the above recommendations in this section for backup.

Report theft immediately to local authorities and your country's embassy or consulate.

Contact your bank to cancel cards and freeze accounts.

Use your document copies to expedite replacements.

Most travel insurance policies require a police report to process theft claims. File one, even for small losses.

## Essential Phone Numbers to Have for Emergencies, or if Your Passport is Lost or Stolen

Preparation turns panic into a plan.

Always store these digitally (in a secure app) and physically (in your luggage or travel wallet) in case your passport goes missing during your trip.

## What to Do If You're Arrested or Detained Abroad

### Stay Calm & Focused:

Ask to contact your embassy or consulate immediately.

It's your legal right in most countries.

Embassy staff can't get you out of jail, but they can ensure your legal rights are observed, help arrange legal counsel and notify family.

Do not sign documents you don't understand. Request a certified translator.

Remain respectful and non-confrontational—arguing, yelling, or showing frustration may escalate things.

Do not bribe police or officials unless explicitly legal or expected in that country (and even then—tread carefully).

Follow local procedures—many countries have strict or unusual rules that may be unfamiliar (e.g., mandatory holding periods, religious court systems).

### Prepare in Advance:

Another reminder to ALWAYS let someone know where you're going!

Remember to set up and let people know your code words in case you are in trouble/danger and cannot speak openly and to verify it's truly your voice as discussed earlier.

Know your embassy's local phone number and address.

Carry emergency contact numbers (and not just saved in your phone).

Be aware of any laws that might impact your behavior: prescription drugs, speech, alcohol, etc.

## Child Safety While Traveling: Protection, Preparedness & Peace of Mind

Explore the world as a family—safely and smartly.

Traveling with children can be incredibly enriching, but it also requires a different level of awareness. From preventing kidnapping and illness to handling medical emergencies or getting separated, a few thoughtful precautions can make all the difference. Here's how to protect your little ones while still embracing the adventure.

### Protecting Children from Kidnapping or Disappearance

**Tips to Prevent Abduction or Accidental Separation:**

Dress kids in bright, recognizable clothing—take a photo each morning in what they're wearing.

Consider using child GPS trackers like:

- Apple AirTags (hidden in shoe or backpack)
- Jiobit Smart Tag
- AngelSense (for children with special needs)

Practice a "What to Do If We Get Separated" plan:

- Stay in one spot.
- Identify a safe adult (e.g., police, store worker).
- Memorize parent's full name and phone number (or wear it as a bracelet).
- Have a safety word that lets you know it's really them.
- Teach them to never leave with a stranger and to scream loud and not stop if someone grabs them.
- Practice saying: "I'm lost. Can you help me call my mom?" preferably to someone in a uniform or a mom with kids.

Choose a clear, visible meeting point at every venue (a landmark, ride, or entrance).

Point it out and repeat it to the child when you arrive.

Do not scare them but let them know that these things just common safety practices that everyone uses, even mommies and daddies.

Use safety wristbands or temporary tattoos with emergency contact info.

Avoid labeling backpacks or clothes with the child's name visible, which could be used to gain false trust.

Keep a card in their pocket with:

- Their Name
- Parent's name
- Emergency phone number
- Hotel name/address
- Language(s) spoken

**Smart Strategies:**

Don't post real-time photos with geotags on social media while still in a location.

In crowded places (markets, amusement parks, airports), consider harness backpacks or stroller safety clips for toddlers.

Never leave children unattended, even briefly, at hotel pools, lobbies, or stores.

### What to Do If Your Child Gets Accidentally Separated in a Public Place

Stay calm, act fast, and follow these steps.

In the high emotion of the moment, having a clear plan of action can mean the difference between panic and resolution. This guide walks you through what to do immediately, and how to prepare your child and yourself before an incident ever happens.

**IMMEDIATE ACTION: IF YOUR CHILD GOES MISSING**

**Pause & Scan**

Stop and look in every direction—kids often wander just a few feet away.

Call out their first name loudly and clearly and listen for their voice.

Look at eye level or lower—children often crouch or hide when scared.

If you have a child with special needs or is prone to wandering off, carry a loud whistle so they can hear and locate you.

**Don't Run Off—Alert Nearby Staff Immediately**

Stay near where they were last seen and alert security, a shopkeeper, or official staff immediately.

Most large public places (airports, museums, parks) have protocols for lost children and can lock down exits or call a "Code Adam" (in North America).

Show them a current photo of your child (preferably the one you took that morning—another great habit).

**Call Out Landmarks to Help Your Child Return**

If safe, use a public address system or ask staff to broadcast a message.

If you're in a mall, amusement park, or zoo, shout things like:
"This is Mom! I'm by the red lion statue at the entrance—stay where you are and I'll come get you!"

**Notify Local Authorities or Police If Not Found Quickly**

If your child isn't found within 5–10 minutes, or you have a suspicion of foul play, contact local police or security immediately.

Provide:

- Child's name, age, height, clothing, and distinguishing features and photo
- Where and when you last saw them
- Any GPS tracker or emergency contact bracelet details

**International Trip Tips:**

If abroad and your child becomes separated:

Notify your embassy or consulate after contacting local police—especially if a longer separation occurs.

Be prepared to show documentation proving parenthood or guardianship if needed.

Accidental separation can happen to even the most attentive parents, especially in new, stimulating environments. Preparation gives your child the confidence to respond calmly and gives you the tools to act effectively. Stay calm, stay local, alert staff, and trust your safety plan.

### Preparing for Medical Emergencies

**Essential Medical Prep:**

Carry a detailed list of medical conditions, medications, and allergies (EpiPens when needed) in both English and the local language.

Pack a child-specific medical kit including:

- Fever/pain reducers (acetaminophen, ibuprofen)
- Antihistamines (Benadryl or generic)
- Electrolyte packets
- Bandages, thermometer, antiseptic wipes
- Meds for nausea, motion sickness, or constipation

**Documentation to Carry:**

Copies of:

- Child's vaccination records
- Health insurance and travel insurance card
- Parental custody documents or letters of permission (if traveling with one parent or non-parent)
- Translated version of prescriptions, especially for controlled medications

**Know Before You Go:**

Find the nearest pediatric hospital or clinic at your destination.

Learn the local emergency number (e.g., 112 in Europe, 911 in the U.S./Canada, 999 in the UK).

Purchase travel insurance with child-specific coverage, including emergency evacuation if doing adventure travel.

### Security Tips in Transit (Airports, Trains, Transfers)

Board early when allowed to get settled with children calmly.

Teach older kids how to find help—point out uniforms of staff, security, etc.

Use child ID cards or bracelets in case of emergencies.

In airports or stations, agree on a "rendezvous point" in case of separation.

### General Travel Safety for Children

**Environmental Awareness:**

Protect against sunburn, dehydration, and heat exhaustion—especially in tropical or desert locations.

Use child-safe insect repellent and mosquito netting in high-risk areas (e.g., malaria zones).

Watch for food and water safety—stick to bottled water and cooked foods for younger kids.

**Road Safety:**

Bring your own travel car seat when possible, or verify safety standards in advance for rentals.

Buckle kids in taxis—even if locals don't. Use portable harness systems if necessary.

### What to Do If a Child Goes Missing

**Immediate Actions:**

Call local police/emergency services immediately.

Notify your embassy or consulate if abroad.

Show authorities the most recent photo of the child (why a daily photo is helpful).

Share any GPS tracking info from a device or tag.

**Extra Tip:**

Some countries (like the U.S.) allow you to register your child's photo and biometric info with embassy programs for faster response in emergencies.

You don't need to be fearful to be careful. With the right preparation and boundaries in place, children can thrive in travel experiences, and you'll feel confident letting them explore the world by your side. Safety empowers freedom—especially for families.
