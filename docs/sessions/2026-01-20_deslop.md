# Session Log: 2026-01-20 - Deslop Cleanup

**Duration:** ~30 minutes
**Focus:** Remove AI-generated code slop from codebase

---

## Executive Summary

Ran the `/deslop` command to analyze and clean up AI-generated code patterns that didn't match the codebase's minimalist style. Removed 39 lines of JSDoc blocks and trailing whitespace across 4 files.

---

## What Was Done

### Deslop Analysis
1. Performed full codebase scan for AI-generated patterns
2. Identified inconsistent JSDoc blocks (codebase doesn't use JSDoc)
3. Found trailing blank lines in media.ts
4. User approved removal of JSDoc + trailing blanks (kept debug logs)

### Files Modified

| File | Lines Removed | What |
|------|---------------|------|
| `lib/db/retry.ts` | 15 | 4 JSDoc blocks |
| `lib/db/media.ts` | 10 | 9 trailing blank lines |
| `app/api/admin/test-newsletter/route.ts` | 9 | 2 JSDoc blocks |
| `lib/email/blogPostNotification.ts` | 5 | 1 JSDoc block |

**Total: 39 lines removed**

## Key Decisions

### Kept (Not Slop)
- **Debug console logs** - Intentional for production debugging, consistent emoji pattern
- **JSX section comments** - Standard React organizational pattern (`{/* Hero Section */}`)
- **REVERT INSTRUCTIONS comment** - Operationally useful documentation in retry.ts
- **`as any` casts** - Necessary workarounds for Three.js and HTML select types
- **eslint-disable comments** - Required to prevent infinite re-render loops

### Removed (Slop)
- JSDoc blocks that didn't match codebase style
- Trailing blank lines (pure whitespace slop)

---

## Codebase Style Profile (Learned)

The Bucket List Doctor codebase follows these conventions:
- **Minimal inline comments** - short, functional
- **No JSDoc documentation** on functions
- **Try-catch only at API boundaries**
- **No unnecessary `any` types** (except for library workarounds)
- **Clean interfaces** defined at top of files
