# Why Not Us Newsletter Template

**Vision:** Build a production-ready, scalable newsletter/blog template that can be deployed for any client with a single click.

## What We're Building

A complete newsletter/blog CMS with:
- Simple username/password authentication (admin.{domain}.com)
- Content management for posts, images, videos, audio, PDFs, documents
- YouTube video integration with thumbnails
- Email newsletter functionality
- Responsive design
- SEO optimization
- Easy deployment to Vercel

## How This Template Works

This template is being developed **in parallel** with Bucket List Doctor. Everything we build for Dr. DeSarbo's site is documented, refined, and abstracted into reusable components that can be deployed for any newsletter client.

### Template Structure

```
wnu-newsletter-template/
├── build/                  # Step-by-step build documentation
├── subagents/             # Specialized subagent instructions
├── guides/                # Best practices and learnings
└── README.md              # This file
```

## Development Philosophy

### ✅ DO
- Document every decision with reasoning
- Create reusable, configurable components
- Keep authentication simple but secure
- Make content management intuitive
- Test with real content (Dr. DeSarbo's)
- Track what works AND what doesn't

### ❌ DON'T
- Over-engineer solutions
- Add unnecessary dependencies
- Create complex authentication flows (keep it simple)
- Hard-code client-specific content
- Skip documentation
- Ignore edge cases

## Deployment Goal

When complete, deploying a new newsletter site should be as simple as:
1. Clone the template repo
2. Configure environment variables (domain, branding, auth)
3. Deploy to Vercel
4. Client gets admin.{domain}.com login
5. Client manages everything themselves

## Why This Matters

Newsletters and personal blogs are booming. People want:
- Ownership of their content (not Medium, not Substack)
- Simple content management
- Professional design
- Easy video/media integration
- Email newsletter capabilities

We're building the tool to give them exactly that.

## Next Steps

1. Build it for Bucket List Doctor
2. Document everything in this folder
3. Abstract to reusable template
4. Create separate git repo
5. Integrate with Why Not Us Labs
6. Scale to 100M newsletters! 🚀
