# Image Status - Navigation Cards

## ✅ All Images Currently Integrated

All navigation cards now have working images! The site is fully functional with no broken image links.

## Current Image Assignments

| Card | Image Used | Type |
|------|-----------|------|
| Books | `bucketlistdoctor-book-cover.png` | ✅ Perfect match |
| Blog | `bucketlistdoctor-worksheet-cover.png` | ✅ Temporary (works well) |
| Contributors | `bucketlist-sailing.jpeg` | ✅ Great fit |
| Travel | `bucketlist-antartica.jpeg` | ✅ Perfect match |
| Tips & Ideas | `bucketlist-sailing.jpeg` | ⚠️ Reused (could be customized) |
| Your Brain | `2d-brain-hero.png` | ✅ Perfect match |
| Doctor/About | `profile-pic-dr-d.png` | ✅ Perfect match |
| Community | `bucketlist-antartica.jpeg` | ⚠️ Reused (could be customized) |

## Optional Future Customizations

While the site is fully functional, you could replace these images for better theme matching:

### 1. Blog Section (Optional)
- **Current:** Worksheet cover (works well!)
- **Alternative idea:** Journal, writing desk, or laptop with blog
- **Priority:** Low (current image is appropriate)

### 2. Tips & Ideas Section (Optional)
- **Current:** Sailing image (reused from Contributors)
- **Alternative idea:** Map, travel planning tools, or checklist
- **Priority:** Medium (to avoid duplication with Contributors card)

### 3. Community Section (Optional)
- **Current:** Antarctica image (reused from Travel)
- **Alternative idea:** Heart logo, group of people, or community gathering
- **Priority:** Medium (to avoid duplication with Travel card)

## Notes

- All images are working with no console errors
- Gradient overlays help unify the different image styles
- The reused images don't look bad - the gradient overlays differentiate them
- Format: JPG or PNG both work fine
- Recommended dimensions: 400-800px wide
