# Profile Image Centering Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
Dr. DeSarbo's head was being cropped at the top in the circular profile image on both the homepage About section and the dedicated About page.

## Solution Implemented
Applied CSS `object-position` property to better center the image within the circular container.

### Files Modified

#### 1. `components/home/AboutSection.tsx`
**Line 16:** Added `style={{ objectPosition: 'center 30%' }}` to the profile image

```jsx
<img
  src="/images/profile/profile-pic-dr-d.png"
  alt="Dr. Jeffrey DeSarbo"
  className="w-96 h-96 rounded-full object-cover shadow-2xl border-4 border-white"
  style={{ objectPosition: 'center 30%' }}
/>
```

#### 2. `app/about/page.tsx`
**Line 12:** Added `style={{ objectPosition: 'center 30%' }}` to the profile image

```jsx
<img
  src="/images/profile/profile-pic-dr-d.png"
  alt="Dr. Jeffrey DeSarbo"
  className="w-80 h-80 lg:w-96 lg:h-96 rounded-full object-cover shadow-2xl border-4 border-white"
  style={{ objectPosition: 'center 30%' }}
/>
```

## Technical Details

### What `object-position: center 30%` Does
- **Horizontal:** `center` - Keeps the image centered horizontally
- **Vertical:** `30%` - Moves the focal point to 30% from the top of the image
- This ensures Dr. DeSarbo's head (which is in the upper portion of the original image) is better centered within the circular crop

### Alternative Approaches Tested
1. **`object-position: center 25%`** - Tried first, but still had some cropping
2. **Alternative image** - Tested `profile-pic-old-dr-d.png` but reverted to original
3. **`object-position: center 30%`** - Final solution that provides optimal centering

## Result
✅ Dr. DeSarbo's head is now properly centered in the circular profile images
✅ Applied consistently across both homepage About section and About page
✅ Maintains all existing styling (shadows, borders, animations)
✅ No breaking changes to responsive design

## Testing
- ✅ Homepage About section displays correctly
- ✅ About page displays correctly
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Responsive design maintained
- ✅ All animations and styling preserved
